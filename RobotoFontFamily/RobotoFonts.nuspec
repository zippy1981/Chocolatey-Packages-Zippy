    <description>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settle in to their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.</description>
