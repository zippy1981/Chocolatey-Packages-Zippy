    <description>Ghostscript is a package of software that provides:
 * An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, with the ability to convert PostScript language files to many raster formats, view them on displays, and print them on printers that don't have PostScript language capability built in;
 * An interpreter for Portable Document Format (PDF) files, with the same abilities;
 * The ability to convert PostScript language files to PDF (with some limitations) and vice versa; and
 * A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression / conversion) capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language and in PDF.
Ghostscript is written entirely in C, with special care taken to make it run properly on a wide variety of systems, including MS Windows, Apple MacOS, the wide variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms and VMS systems.</description>
