    <description>Fossil is a cross-platform server that runs on Linux, BSD derivatives, Mac and Windows. It is capable of performing distributed version control, bug tracking, wiki services, and blogging. The software has a built-in web interface, which reduces project tracking complexity and promotes situational awareness. A user may simply type "fossil ui" from within any check-out and Fossil automatically opens the user's web browser in a page that gives detailed history and status information on that project.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Fossil v 1.27 (2013-09-11 11:43:49)
Key changes in this release include:

Enhance the fossil changes, fossil clean, fossil extras, fossil ls and fossil status commands to restrict operation to files and directories named on the command-line.
New --integrate option to fossil merge, which automatically closes the merged branch when committing.
Renamed /stats_report page to /reports. Graph width is now relative, not absolute.
Added yw=YYYY-WW (year-week) filter to timeline to limit the results to a specific year and calendar week number, e.g. /timeline?yw=2013-01.
Updates to SQLite to prevent opening a repository file using file descriptors 1 or 2 on unix. This fixes a bug under which an assertion failure could overwrite part of a repository database file, corrupting it.
Added support for unlimited line lengths in side-by-side diffs.
New --close option to fossil commit, which immediately closes the branch being committed.
Added chart option to fossil bisect.
Improvements to the "human or bot?" determination.
Reports errors about missing CGI-standard environment variables for HTTP servers which do not support them.
Minor improvements to sync support on Windows.
Added --scgi option to fossil server.
Internal improvements to the sync process.
The internals of the JSON API are now MIT-licensed, so downstream users/packagers are no longer affected by the "do no evil" license clause.
